# Backtick-on-Shift-Escape

This is an AutoHotKey script that presses Backtick (`) when you press Shift and Escape.

This is an issue that occurs on 60%-65% keyboards when a manufacturer's keybind for backtick is awful, and you are trying to play Roblox without playing finger Jenga when accessing your inventory.

This program also has compatiblity with my other script for these types of issues (you can run them at the same time)! You can find that here: https://github.com/Konpoolu/Tilde-On-Shift-Tab

**Please note that the .AHK scripts require a download of AutoHotKey V1, which can be found here: https://www.autohotkey.com/ The .EXE versions of the files are flagged by Windows Defender. Hit "More Info" and "Run Anyway" to run the script.**
